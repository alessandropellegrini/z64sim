# Release Notes

This is still an Alpha version, so part of the logic is still missing, and proper testing was not carried out yet.

Major changes in this version:
- Several fixes into the grammar.
- CPU register view has been introduced.
- The assembler is attached to the GUI.
- Program loading implemented.
- Memory view implemented.
- Preliminary implementation of instruction run algorithms. Still incomplete.
- Update checker: the application will check for updates at startup.
